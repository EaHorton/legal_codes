"Injured in either of the ways above mentioned, the husband or the wife may exhibit, in 1814, his or her petition or libel to one of the Judges of the Superior Courts of Law in this State, in term time, or to one of the Judges in the vacation, at least thirty days before the next term, setting forth therein particularly and especially the causes of his or her complaint; and shall, together with such petition or libel, exhibit an affidavit on oath, taken before one of the Judges of the Superior Courts, or some Justice living in the county where he or she resides, that the facts contained in the said petition or libel are true to the best of his or her knowledge and belief, and that the said complaint is not made out of levity or by collusion between the said husband and wife, and for the mere purpose of being freed and separated from each other; but in sincerity and truth for the causes mentioned in the said petition of libel. 

Bond with sufficient security for the prosecution of the same being first given as required in other cases at law; and thereupon a subpoena may and shall issue from the said court, directed to the person so complained against; commanding him or her to appear at the next Superior Court of Law to be held for the said county, then and there to plead or answer to the said petition or libel; and upon due proof at the return of the said process that a copy thereof was served either personally on the said party or that he or she could not be found, and that a copy thereof was left at his or her usual or last place of abode in said county, at least fifteen days before the day of the said return inclusive; if he or she shall refuse or neglect to appear, then an alias subpoena shall issue, returnable to the first day of the next term and be served personally in manner aforesaid; but if he or she cannot be found, then proclamation shall be publicly made by the Sheriff at the door of the court-house, for the party to appear and answer as commanded by the subpoena; and that notice thereof be given in two newspapers, such as the court may order, for three months; and in the meantime the said court shall and may make such preparatory rules and orders in the cause as may be necessary to prepare the same for trial, when the court may determine ex parte, if necessary; Provided always, That in all suits commenced under this act, the material facts charged in the said petition or libel shall be submitted to a jury, upon whose verdict, and not otherwise, the court shall decree—any rule or practice to the contrary notwithstanding.

II. Be it further enacted, That in any action or suit commenced in any of said courts for a divorce for the cause of adultery, if it shall be proved that the plaintiff has been guilty of the like crime, or has admitted the defendant into conjugal society after he or she knew of the criminal fact, or that the said plaintiff (if the husband) allowed of his wife's prostitution or exposed her to lewd company whereby she became ensnared to the crime aforesaid, it shall be a good defense and a perpetual bar against the said suits.

IV. Be it further enacted, That it shall and may be lawful for the Superior Court aforesaid after hearing any cause commenced in virtue of this act, to determine the same as to law and justice shall appertain by either dismissing the petition or libel, or sentencing and decreeing a divorce and separation from nuptial ties or bonds of matrimony, or that the marriage is null and void, agreeable to the prayer thereof; and such court shall have power to decree alimony to the wife in the case of general divorce upon the petition of the wife: Provided, That no judgment, sentence or decree of final and absolute divorce from the bonds of matrimony shall be valid unless ratified by the General Assembly of this State; and that after such ratifying or dissolving the marriage and its ratification by the General Assembly, all and every the duties, rights and claims, arising in right of said marriage shall cease and determine, and the complainant or innocent person shall be at liberty to marry again as if he or she had never been married; Provided always, That nothing herein contained shall be construed to extend to affect or render illegitimate any child or children born of the body of the wife during the coverture.

V. Be it further enacted, That if any person shall either abandon his family or maliciously turn his wife out of doors, or by cruel or barbarous treatment endanger her life, or offer such indignities to her person as to render her condition intolerable or life burdensome, it shall and may be lawful for the Superior Court upon complaint and due proof made in manner aforesaid, to grant a divorce from bed and board and also to allow her such alimony as her husband’s circumstances will admit, not exceeding one third part of the annual income or profits of his estate, or of his occupation or labors, or by assigning to her separate use, such part of the real and personal estate of the husband as the court shall think fit, not exceeding one third part of the husband’s estate, as the justice of the case may require; which shall continue until a reconciliation shall take place between the parties. Provided always, That nothing herein contained shall be construed in any wise to affect the rights of any creditor or creditors of the husband.

VI. And to guard the persons thus injured against the heat of momentary passion, and to afford time for reflection and opportunity for reconciliation, Be it enacted, That no petition shall be sustained in said courts unless the petitioner shall state and swear that the facts the ground of his or her complaint have existed to his or her knowledge for the space of six months before filing the same."
