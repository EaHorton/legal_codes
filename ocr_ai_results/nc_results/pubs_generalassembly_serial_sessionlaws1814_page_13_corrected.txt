The tax collectors are hereby fully authorized, empowered, and required to collect the same accordingly.

II. And be it further enacted, that this act shall be in force from and after the ratification of the same.

It is hereby forbidden from giving his opinion on any matter of law which may have arisen on the trial of said case in any of the courts below, which said judge may have held.

And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that the judges of the Superior Courts shall and may hereafter arrange their respective ridings as to them shall seem fit, so as not to be located to any particular circuit.
