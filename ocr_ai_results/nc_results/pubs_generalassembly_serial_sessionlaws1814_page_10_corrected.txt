CHAP. VII.
AN ACT to amend an act passed in the year one thousand seven hundred and forty-one, entitled "An Act for the better observation and keeping the Lordâ€™s Day, commonly called Sunday, and for the more effectual suppression of vice and immorality."

WHEREAS by the before recited act whenever a single woman shall upon oath before two Magistrates according to its provisions, accuse any man with being the father of her bastard child or children, such person so accused shall be adjudged the reputed father of such child or children, and stand charged with the maintenance thereof: And whereas the said act by rendering the oath of the woman alone conclusive evidence of the fact, so far from operating as a suppression of vice and immorality, has a contrary effect:

BE it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of North Carolina, and it is hereby enacted by the authority of the same, That whenever any man shall in the manner prescribed in the before recited act be accused by any single woman of being the father of her bastard child or children, the person so accused shall upon the return to the County Court of the recognizance, capias or attachment, as the case may be, be entitled to have an issue made up to try whether he be the father of such child or children; upon the trial of which issue the examination of the woman upon oath taken before two Justices of the Peace in the manner prescribed by the aforesaid act and returned to court, shall be prima facie evidence only against the person so accused. And if the jury shall, upon the trial of such issue, find that the person so accused is the father of such child or children, he shall stand charged with the maintenance thereof in the manner prescribed by the said act: But if the jury shall find that he is not the father of such child or children, he shall be discharged. And all examinations upon oath to accuse or charge any man of being the father of a bastard child shall be had and taken within three years next after the birth of said child, and not after.

II. Be it further enacted, That all costs which shall accrue upon the trial of any issue under this act, shall be paid by the party claiming the benefit of such issue.

III. And be it further enacted, That the officer, prosecuting on behalf of the county, shall, and he is hereby authorized to appeal to the Superior Court of Law in all cases where he shall think that justice has not been obtained in the trial of any issue.

CHAP. VIII.
AN Act to amend the Revenue Laws of this State and to provide a Revenue for the payment of the Civil List and Contingent charges of Government.

BE it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of North Carolina, and it is hereby enacted by the authority of the same, That the tax on all lands and their improvements throughout this State shall be levied and collected in the following manner, to wit: the Justices of the Peace appointed to take the lists of taxable property within the several counties of the State according to the direction of the act of the General Assembly passed in the year one thousand eight hundred and one, entitled "An act to fix a uniform time for taking the list throughout the State and for enforcing the collection of taxes" shall after following the direction of the before recited act, require each and every person, peaceably or otherwise to list each and every tract of land by him, her, or them held within the county, stating the number of acres of each separate tract, its location and its reasonable value, including improvements thereon: And where the dividing line between two counties, runs through any tract of land the owner of the said land may list the same in either county: And it shall be the duty of Guardians to list the lands of their wards being minors; and also the duty of Guardians of Lunatics and persons non compos mentis to list the lands belonging to the said lunatics and persons non compos mentis. And if any person holding lands or any Guardian of a minor, lunatic, or person non compos mentis shall fail to list the lands which he is bound to list by this act, he shall pay a double tax to be collected by the Sheriff out of the property of the person bound to list the said lands by distress or other mode heretofore used in such cases.

II. And be it further enacted, That the justices appointed as aforesaid shall make a fair copy of the list of lands by him taken with the number of acres and valuation annexed, and return the same together with the list of other taxable property by him taken to the Clerk of the County Court at the next succeeding County Court which may happen after the time prescribed by law for taking the list of taxable property. And the Clerks of the several County Courts are hereby required to return to the Comptroller a list of such lands and the owners' names thereof with the number of acres of each tract, and the valuation of the same as is by law already established and required, on or before the first day of September in each and every year hereafter.

III. And be it further enacted, That the Clerks of the several County Courts shall within forty days after the justices have made their returns deliver to the Sheriff of the county a fair and accurate copy of the returns made by the justices as aforesaid; and in case of failure thereof to be under the same rules and penalties as are already prescribed by law. And the respective Sheriffs shall proceed after the first day of March in each and every year to collect the said taxes, and shall account for the same, on or before the first day of October, in every year, under the same rules and penalties as are now by law established.
