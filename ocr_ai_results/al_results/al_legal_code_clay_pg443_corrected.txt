No pardon, granted by the governor in any one of the cases stated in this section, shall have the effect to remove the disability imposed, unless such pardon shall so express upon its face.

Section 30: Upon all convictions on indictments under the sections of this chapter, which inhibit the use or exhibiting of any gaming table or bank, or which makes it penal for the owner or occupant of any house to permit or suffer the same to be used for the keeping or exhibition of any gaming table or bank, the attorney-general, or solicitor, shall be entitled to a fee of one hundred dollars; upon convictions on indictments under any other section of the law against gaming, the attorney-general, or solicitor, shall be entitled to a fee of forty dollars; and upon all convictions in which the punishment shall be imprisonment in the penitentiary, the attorney-general, or solicitor, shall be entitled to a fee of twenty dollars, and from all other convictions, to a fee of five dollars, to be taxed in the bill of costs, and paid by the party convicted.

Section 31: After every conviction and sentence for offence made punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary, the clerk shall issue a fieri facias, on the judgment which shall be rendered in favor of the state, in usual form, for the collection of the costs of the prosecution, and for the collection of the value of the property assessed by the jury, in larceny and other cases authorized by law.

Section 32: That sheriffs, coroners and constables may be vested with ample power to enable them to discharge the duties devolved upon them, they are hereby authorized, in cases not otherwise provided for by this code, to summon to their aid a sufficient number of posse of their county, to enable them to execute all process, civil or criminal, or to arrest all offenders against the law, in instances which they are authorized to proceed without process, or to convey all persons in custody, from place to place, pursuant to law. Any person, summoned by either of such officers as aforesaid, who shall refuse obedience to the summons, shall, upon conviction, be fined in a sum not less than fifty and not exceeding one hundred dollars; and it shall be the duty of the officer to present the case of such offender to the grand jury, at the next term of the circuit court of the county, that the same may be examined according to law.

Section 33: Any person, summoned by a sheriff, coroner or constable, as in the last section provided, shall not be liable to an action for obeying such summons, by reason of any defect or irregularity in the authority of such officer, provided he did nothing more than was allowed, had his authority been regular and authentic.

Section 34: The persons summoned as aforesaid, if employed as long as one day, shall be allowed the same compensation as is allowed to guards who aid in conveying convicts to the penitentiary, and shall be paid from the same fund, unless their services were otherwise provided for.
