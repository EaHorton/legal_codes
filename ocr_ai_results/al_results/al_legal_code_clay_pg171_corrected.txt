Divorces.

§ 10. It shall be deemed necessary for the court, upon the conclusion of a divorce case, to provide the party in whose favor the decree is rendered, a complete record of the proceedings and evidence in said suit. This record shall be certified by the court clerk, sealed, and directed to the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the State of Alabama, with an endorsement indicating that it contains a decree for a divorce. This decree shall be delivered to said Speaker by the court clerk or attorney within the duration of the legislative session.

§ 11. It shall be the duty of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, in the presence of the members of the House, to open such record, and cause the same to be read and proceeded on, in accordance with the constitution of the State of Alabama.

§ 12. If it appears to the court that the adultery complained of was occasioned by collusion of the parties, and done with the intention to procure a divorce, then no divorce shall be decreed.

§ 13. If any persons cohabit together, after a divorce for the cause of adultery, such persons, so offending, shall be liable to the punishments and penalties provided by the laws then existing.

§ 14. If it shall appear that the complainant has been guilty of adultery, and has admitted the defendant into conjugal society or embraces, after he or she knew of the criminal fact, or that the complainant (if the husband) allowed his wife's prostitution, it shall be a bar against a divorce for such previous misconduct.

§ 15. In all cases, where both parties shall be guilty of adultery, it shall be a bar to a divorce. In order to prevent collusion between the parties, in no case shall the admission of them, or either of them, be received in any case of divorce.

§ 16. In no case of divorce shall the party, against whom such divorce may be granted, or who may have been guilty of any of the offences upon which such divorce may have been granted, be allowed to marry again. If the said party shall marry again, such marriage is hereby declared null and void. The party, so offending, shall be liable to such penalties as are prescribed for the crime of adultery.

§ 17. No person shall be permitted to commence a suit in chancery for a divorce, until he or she shall have been an inhabitant of this state, for at least three years preceding the application.

§ 18. Divorce from bed and board may be granted for extreme cruelty in either of the parties, on the application of the party aggrieved, by the same proceedings in the chancery court of the county, in which the complainant may reside, as are, or may be required by law to be had, on a bill, praying divorce from the bonds of matrimony. The decree of such chancery court shall be final.

§ 19. The courts of chancery shall have power, in all cases of separation between man and wife, and where neither party shall obtain a divorce, to give the custody and education of the children to either the father or mother, as to them may seem right and proper, having regard to the prudence and ability of the parents, and the age and sex of the child or children.

§ 20. The courts of chancery shall have power, in cases of the separation of parents, to permit either the mother or father to have the care and education of the children, or any of them, as to said courts may seem just and proper. This shall be determined and decided on by the court.
