Corrected Text:

A divorce shall have effect, until it shall be confirmed by both houses of the assembly.

Section 2. Where a marriage has been contracted and celebrated between two persons, and it shall be proven that one party, at the time of the contract, was, and still is, naturally impotent, in every such case, it shall be lawful for the injured party to obtain, in the manner heretofore provided by law, a divorce from the bond of matrimony.

Section 3. The several courts of this state are hereby invested with full power and authority to decree divorces, in the manner prescribed by law in the following cases, that is to say: in favor of the husband, where his wife has been taken in adultery, or has voluntarily left his bed and board for the space of three years, with the intention of abandonment; and in favor of the wife, where her husband has left her for the space of three years, with the intention of abandonment; or where he shall have abandoned her, and lived in adultery with another woman; or where his treatment to her is cruel, barbarous, and inhuman.

Section 4. In the cases before-mentioned, the party desirous of obtaining a divorce may apply to the chancery court of that county, in which he or she resides, by a bill in chancery, stating the grounds of the application, on which such proceedings shall be had, as are usual in other suits in chancery.

Section 5. If the court shall be satisfied, that the defendant is not a resident of this state, an order of publication shall be made as in other cases of non-resident defendants, except that the order shall sufficiently describe the object of the bill.

Section 6. The defendant may appear and answer the complainant's bill, under oath, denying the allegations thereof, or if the defendant shall fail to appear and answer, the cause may be set down for trial, but the bill shall not be taken for confessed, but proof shall be required to support the allegations thereof, as in cases where they are denied by answer.

Section 7. The court may pronounce a decree for a divorce, according to the provisions of this act; but such decree shall not operate so as to release the offending party, who shall remain, nevertheless, subject to all liabilities and penalties, which the law prescribes against a married person, where a former wife or husband is living.

Section 8. The court pronouncing the decree of divorce, shall also order a division of the estate of the parties, in such manner as to them shall seem just and right, having due regard to the rights of each party and their children, if any: Provided, however, That nothing herein contained, shall be construed to compel either party to divest him or herself of the title to real estate.

Section 9. Pending a suit for divorce, the court may make such temporary orders, respecting the property and parties, as they shall deem appropriate.

Any marriage contracted while there is a former wife or husband living at the time of such marriage, shall be invalid from the beginning and absolutely void.

The act of September 23, 1824, repeals this law as to all the grounds of divorce above except that of "natural impotency," continuing at the time of the marriage, which still allows for a divorce by the party injured. The concluding part of each section suggests obvious reasons why they should be retained, at least in part.
