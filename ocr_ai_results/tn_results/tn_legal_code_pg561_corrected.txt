to those residing south of French Broad and Holston, and between
North Carolina and Tennessee, and for other purposes. [Passed
by the General Assembly of the State of Tennessee.]

It is lawful for the treasurer of East Tennessee to withhold
or collect, any portion of the money now due by the people residing south of the rivers French Broad and between the rivers Big Pigeon and Tennessee, but that the said principal sum shall remain a lien on the lands into whose hands they may come. Provided, That nothing in this act shall be construed as to deter future Legislature from calling for the payment of interest provided for by this act, in such manner as they may seem fit. 

The interest now due on the purchase money by the people residing in the aforesaid county, unless it is already provided for, shall be by them paid into the office of the Treasurer of East Tennessee, in the following manner; that is to say: the interest due for the year eighteen hundred and eighteen, on the first day of January in the year 1820; the interest due for the year eighteen hundred and nineteen, on the first day of January 1821. And the said Treasurer of East Tennessee is prohibited from collecting any sum or sums of money which is not provided for by this act, or its supplementary, passed November 1817, entitled "An Act to suspend the collection of the interest on purchase money due by the inhabitants residing south of French Broad and Holston, and between the Big Pigeon and Tennessee rivers."

If the interest is not paid in the aforesaid manner, or if the person has failed, or shall hereafter fail to pay, then the Treasurer of East Tennessee is authorized to proceed with the collection in such manner as the law directs.
